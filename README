= Overview =
Ptrace-sampler is a simple profiling tool for C/C++ applications under Linux.
It is based on the idea of the "poor man's profiler": it attaches to the
to-be-profiled process using the Linux ptrace() interface (like a debugger)
and periodically collects the current stack trace of the process.
From these stack traces it can be seen where the process spent most of its
time, using the excellent KCachegrind tool as analysis GUI.

= License =
GPL v3 (TODO: include full GPL text)

= Requirements =
* Linux
* Python 2.4+
* several system tools (objdump, nm, readelf, addr2line)
* only for initial building: g++, make
* optionally: libbfd
* optionally: libunwind
* only for profile data analysis: KCachegrind
** if necessary, the calltree file created by start_sampling.sh/samples2calltree.py
can be copied to another system where KCachegrind is installed

= Installation =
Run "make" to compile. Run "make release" to create a .tgz which contains
the complete profiling tool. 

= Basic Usage =
Run "start_sampling.sh" followed by the PID or name of the running process
to be profiled. This will create a trace file with periodic backtraces.
Hit Ctrl+C after some seconds; this will stop profiling and will create
a Calltree file which is then displayed in KCachegrind (note: this post-
processing step might take some minutes on the first run).

In KCachegrind, useful views are:
* call graph
* annotated source code (make sure the source code is available, and its
location is specified in KCachegrind preferences)
* assembly code
* Flat Profile (sorted by Incl. or Self)

= Undocumented Parts =
* ptrace-sampler command line options
* sample_reader.py, resolve_addr.py
* ~/.cache/ptrace-sampler/ directory
* threading support
* libunwind support
* frame pointer heuristic
* glibc debug info generation
* VDSO/syscall problems
* test apps
